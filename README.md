# Rebol-Lexer
Determine if a string (or binary) represents loadable Rebol code.
Implemented as a Parse Expression Grammar (PEG).
Written in Rebol (3 Alpha), so, this grammar can (and does) pass itself.
Could be made Rebol 2 compatible, at the cost of some readability (Rebol 2 PARSE neither has "and" nor "not").
